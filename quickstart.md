# Quick start

Liquor is a framework for backend development in web applications. It provides a boilerplate to kickstart your application without worrying about the HTTP server, dependency injection, or database connection.


First, letâ€™s install the CLI, which serves as a helper for executing various functions:

```
go install github.com/go-liquor/liquor@latest
```

Now, the CLI is installed in your environment. (Make sure GOBIN is set in your PATH for it to work properly.)

You can verify the installation by running:

```
liquor --help
```
